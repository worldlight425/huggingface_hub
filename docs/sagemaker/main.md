<h1>Hugging Face on Amazon SageMaker</h1>

![cover](/docs/assets/sagemaker/cover.png)


Earlier this year [we announced a strategic collaboration with Amazon](https://huggingface.co/blog/the-partnership-amazon-sagemaker-and-hugging-face) to make it easier for companies to use Hugging Face in SageMaker, and ship cutting-edge Machine Learning features faster. We introduced new Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) to[ train Hugging Face Transformer models in Amazon SageMaker](https://huggingface.co/transformers/sagemaker.html#getting-started-train-a-transformers-model).


## Features & Benefits ðŸ”¥

### One Command is All you Need

With the new Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers available in Amazon SageMaker, training <!-- and deploying -->
cutting-edge Transformers-based NLP models has never been simpler. There are variants specially optimized for TensorFlow and PyTorch, for single-GPU, single-node multi-GPU and multi-node clusters.

### Accelerating Machine Learning from Science to Production

In addition to Hugging Face DLCs, we created a first-class Hugging Face extension to the SageMaker Python-sdk to accelerate data science teams, reducing the time required to set up and run experiments from days to minutes.

You can use the Hugging Face DLCs with the Automatic Model Tuning capability of Amazon SageMaker, in order to automatically optimize your training hyperparameters and quickly increase the accuracy of your models.

You can deploy your trained models for inference with just one more line of code, or select any of the 10,000+ publicly available models from the Model Hub, and deploy them with Amazon SageMaker.


Thanks to the SageMaker Studio web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE), you can easily track and compare your experiments and your training artifacts.

### Built-in Performance

With the Hugging Face DLCs, SageMaker customers will benefit from built-in performance optimizations for PyTorch or TensorFlow, to train NLP models faster, and with the flexibility to choose the training<!-- inference --> infrastructure with the best price/performance ratio for your workload.

The Hugging Face Training DLCs are fully integrated with the SageMaker distributed training libraries, to train models faster than was ever possible before, using the latest generation of instances available on Amazon EC2.

The Hugging Face Inference DLCs provide you with production-ready endpoints that scale easily within your AWS environment, with built-in monitoring and a ton of enterprise features.
