# Manage `huggingface_hub` cache-system

## Understand caching

The Hugging Face Hub cache-system is designed to be the central cache shared across libraries
that depend on the Hub. It has been updated in v0.8.0 to prevent re-downloading same files
between revisions.

The caching system is designed as follows:

```
<CACHE_DIR>
├─ <MODELS>
├─ <DATASETS>
├─ <SPACES>
```

The `<CACHE_DIR>` is usually your user's home directory. However, it is customizable with the
`cache_dir` argument on all methods, or by specifying either `HF_HOME` or
`HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE` environment variable.

Models, datasets and spaces share a common root. Each of these repositories contains the
repository type, the namespace (organization or username) if it exists and the
repository name:

```
<CACHE_DIR>
├─ models--julien-c--EsperBERTo-small
├─ models--lysandrejik--arxiv-nlp
├─ models--bert-base-cased
├─ datasets--glue
├─ datasets--huggingface--DataMeasurementsFiles
├─ spaces--dalle-mini--dalle-mini
```

It is within these folders that all files will now be downloaded from the Hub. Caching ensures that
a file isn't downloaded twice if it already exists and wasn't updated; but if it was updated,
and you're asking for the latest file, then it will download the latest file (while keeping
the previous file intact in case you need it again).

In order to achieve this, all folders contain the same skeleton:

```
<CACHE_DIR>
├─ datasets--glue
│  ├─ refs
│  ├─ blobs
│  ├─ snapshots
...
```

Each folder is designed to contain the following:

### Refs

The `refs` folder contains files which indicates the latest revision of the given reference. For example,
if we have previously fetched a file from the `main` branch of a repository, the `refs`
folder will contain a file named `main`, which will itself contain the commit identifier of the current head.

If the latest commit of `main` has `aaaaaa` as identifier, then it will contain `aaaaaa`.

If that same branch gets updated with a new commit, that has `bbbbbb` as an identifier, then
re-downloading a file from that reference will update the `refs/main` file to contain `bbbbbb`.

### Blobs

The `blobs` folder contains the actual files that we have downloaded. The name of each file is their hash.

### Snapshots

The `snapshots` folder contains symlinks to the blobs mentioned above. It is itself made up of several folders:
one per known revision!

In the explanation above, we had initially fetched a file from the `aaaaaa` revision, before fetching a file from
the `bbbbbb` revision. In this situation, we would now have two folders in the `snapshots` folder: `aaaaaa`
and `bbbbbb`.

In each of these folders, live symlinks that have the names of the files that we have downloaded. For example,
if we had downloaded the `README.md` file at revision `aaaaaa`, we would have the following path:

```
<CACHE_DIR>/<REPO_NAME>/snapshots/aaaaaa/README.md
```

That `README.md` file is actually a symlink linking to the blob that has the hash of the file.

By creating the skeleton this way we open the mechanism to file sharing: if the same file was fetched in
revision `bbbbbb`, it would have the same hash and the file would not need to be re-downloaded.

### In practice

In practice, your cache should look like the following tree:

```text
    [  96]  .
    └── [ 160]  models--julien-c--EsperBERTo-small
        ├── [ 160]  blobs

```

## Scan your cache

At the moment, cached files are never deleted from your local directory: when you download
a new revision of a branch, previous files are kept in case you need them again.
Therefore it can be useful to scan your cache directory in order to know which repos
and revisions are taking the most disk space. `huggingface_hub` provides an helper to
do so that can be used via `huggingface-cli` or in a python script.

### From the terminal

The easiest way to scan your HF cache-system is to use the `scan-cache` command from
`huggingface-cli` tool. This command scans the cache and prints a report with information
like repo id, repo type, disk usage, refs and full local path.

The snippet below shows a scan report in a folder in which 4 models and 2 datasets are
cached.

```text
➜ huggingface-cli scan-cache

Done in 0.0s. Scanned 6 repo(s) for a total of 3.4G.

```

To get a more detailed report, use the `--verbose` option. For each repo, you get a
list of all revisions that have been downloaded. As explained above, the files that don't
change between 2 revisions are shared thanks to the symlinks. This means that the size of
the repo on disk is expected to be less than the sum of the size of each of its revisions.
For example, here `bert-base-cased` has 2 revisions of 1.4G and 1.5G but the total disk
usage is only 1.9G.

#### Grep example

Since the output is in tabular format, you can combine it with any `grep`-like tools to
filter the entries. Here is an example to filter only revisions from the "t5-small"
model on a Unix-based machine.

```text
➜ eval "huggingface-cli scan-cache -v" | grep "t5-small"
t5-small                    model     98ffebbb27340ec1b1abd7c45da12c253ee1882a       726.2M        6 refs/pr/1   /Users/lucain/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--t5-small/snapshots/98ffebbb27340ec1b1abd7c45da12c253ee1882a
t5-small                    model     d0a119eedb3718e34c648e594394474cf95e0617       485.8M        6             /Users/lucain/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--t5-small/snapshots/d0a119eedb3718e34c648e594394474cf95e0617
t5-small                    model     d78aea13fa7ecd06c29e3e46195d6341255065d5       970.7M        9 main        /Users/lucain/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--t5-small/snapshots/d78aea13fa7ecd06c29e3e46195d6341255065d5
```

### From Python

For a more advanced usage, use [`scan_cache_dir`] which is the python utility called by
the CLI tool.

You can use it to get a detailed report structured around 4 dataclasses:

- [`HFCacheInfo`]: complete report returned by [`scan_cache_dir`]
- [`CachedRepoInfo`]: information about a cached repo
- [`CachedRevisionInfo`]: information about a cached revision (e.g. "snapshot") inside a repo
- [`CachedFileInfo`]: information about a cached file in a snapshot

Here is a simple usage example. See reference for details.

```py
>>> from huggingface_hub import scan_cache_dir

>>> hf_cache_info = scan_cache_dir()
HFCacheInfo(
    size_on_disk=3398085269,
    repos=frozenset({
        CachedRepoInfo(
            repo_id='t5-small',
            repo_type='model',
            repo_path=PosixPath(...),
            size_on_disk=970726914,
            nb_files=11,
            revisions=frozenset({
                CachedRevisionInfo(
                    commit_hash='d78aea13fa7ecd06c29e3e46195d6341255065d5',
                    size_on_disk=970726339,
                    snapshot_path=PosixPath(...),
                    files=frozenset({
                        CachedFileInfo(
                            file_name='config.json',
                            size_on_disk=1197
                            file_path=PosixPath(...),
                            blob_path=PosixPath(...),
                        ),
                        CachedFileInfo(...),
                        ...
                    }),
                ),
                CachedRevisionInfo(...),
                ...
            }),
        ),
        CachedRepoInfo(...),
        ...
    }),
    warnings=[
        CorruptedCacheException("Snapshots dir doesn't exist in cached repo: ..."),
        CorruptedCacheException(...),
        ...
    ],
)
```
