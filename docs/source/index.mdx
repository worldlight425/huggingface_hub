# Hub client library

The `huggingface_hub` library allows you to interact with the [Hugging Face
Hub](https://hf.co), a machine learning platform for creators and collaborators.
Discover pre-trained models and datasets for your projects or play with the hundreds of
machine learning apps hosted on the Hub. You can also create and share your own models
and datasets with the community. The `huggingface_hub` library provides a simple way to
do all these things with Python.

Read the [quick start guide](quick-start) to get up and running with the
`huggingface_hub` library. You will learn how to download files from the Hub, create a
repository, and upload files to the Hub.

Keep reading to learn even more about how to:

- [Delete and clone a repository, and create and update a branch](how-to-manage).
- [Download an entire repository and use regex matching to filter and download specific
  files](how-to-downstream).
- [Upload your files with a context manager or use a helper to push files to a remote
  repository](how-to-upstream).
- [Search thousands of models and datasets on the Hub with specific filters and
  parameters to only return the best results](searching-the-hub).
- [Access the Inference API for accelerated inference](how-to-inference).
- [Interact with Discussions and Pull Requests ](how-to-discussions-and-pull-requests).
