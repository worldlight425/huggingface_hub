# Utilities

## Controlling the logging of `huggingface_hub`

The `huggingface_hub` package exposes a `logging` utility to control the logging level of the package itself.
You can import it as such:

```py
from huggingface_hub import logging
```

Then, you may define the verbosity in order to update the amount of logs you'll see:

```python
from huggingface_hub import logging

logging.set_verbosity_error()
logging.set_verbosity_warning()
logging.set_verbosity_info()
logging.set_verbosity_debug()

logging.set_verbosity(...)
```

The levels should be understood as follows:

- `error`: only show critical logs about usage which may result in an error or unexpected behavior.
- `warning`: show logs that aren't critical but usage may result in unintended behavior.
  Additionally, important informative logs may be shown.
- `info`: show most logs, including some verbose logging regarding what is happening under the hood.
  If something is behaving in an unexpected manner, we recommend switching the verbosity level to this in order
  to get more information.
- `debug`: show all logs, including some internal logs which may be used to track exactly what's happening
  under the hood.

### Repo-specific helper methods

The methods exposed below are relevant when modifying modules from the `huggingface_hub` library itself.
Using these shouldn't be necessary if you use `huggingface_hub` and you don't modify them.

## Handling HTTP errors

`huggingface_hub` defines its own HTTP errors to refine the `HTTPError` raised by
`requests` with additional information sent back by the server.

### Raise for status

[`~utils.hf_raise_for_status`] is meant to be the central method to "raise for status" from any
request made to the Hub. It wraps the base `requests.raise_for_status` to provide
additional information. Any `HTTPError` thrown is converted into a `HfHubHTTPError`.

```py
import requests
from huggingface_hub.utils import hf_raise_for_status, HfHubHTTPError

response = requests.post(...)
try:
    hf_raise_for_status(response)
except HfHubHTTPError as e:
    print(str(e)) # formatted message
    e.request_id, e.server_message # details returned by server

    # Complete the error message with additional information once it's raised
    e.append_to_message("\n`create_commit` expects the repository to exist.")
    raise
```

### HTTP errors

Here is a list of HTTP errors thrown in `huggingface_hub`.

#### HfHubHTTPError

`HfHubHTTPError` is the parent class for any HF Hub HTTP error. It takes care of parsing
the server response and format the error message to provide as much information to the
user as possible.

#### RepositoryNotFoundError

[[autodoc]] huggingface_hub.utils.RepositoryNotFoundError

#### RevisionNotFoundError

[[autodoc]] huggingface_hub.utils.RevisionNotFoundError

#### EntryNotFoundError

[[autodoc]] huggingface_hub.utils.EntryNotFoundError

#### BadRequestError

[[autodoc]] huggingface_hub.utils.BadRequestError

#### LocalEntryNotFoundError

[[autodoc]] huggingface_hub.utils.LocalEntryNotFoundError

## Validators

`huggingface_hub` include custom validators to validate method arguments automatically.
Validation is inspired by the work done in [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)
to validate type hints but with more limited features.

### Generic decorator

[`~utils.validate_hf_hub_args`] is a generic decorator to encapsulate
methods that have arguments following `huggingface_hub`'s naming. By default, all
arguments that has a validator implemented will be validated.

If an input is not valid, a [`~utils.HFValidationError`] is thrown. Only
the first non-valid value throws an error and stops the validation process.

Usage:

```py
>>> from huggingface_hub.utils import validate_hf_hub_args

>>> @validate_hf_hub_args
... def my_cool_method(repo_id: str):
...     print(repo_id)

>>> my_cool_method(repo_id="valid_repo_id")
valid_repo_id

>>> my_cool_method("other..repo..id")
huggingface_hub.utils._validators.HFValidationError: Cannot have -- or .. in repo_id: 'other..repo..id'.

>>> my_cool_method(repo_id="other..repo..id")
huggingface_hub.utils._validators.HFValidationError: Cannot have -- or .. in repo_id: 'other..repo..id'.
```

#### HFValidationError

### Argument validators

Validators can also be used individually. Here is a list of all arguments that can be
validated.

#### `repo_id`
