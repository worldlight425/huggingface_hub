## Caching

The methods displayed above are designed to work with a caching system that prevents re-downloading files.
The caching system was updated in v0.8.0 to allow directory structure and file sharing across
libraries that depend on the hub.

The caching system is designed as follows:

```
<CACHE_DIR>
├─ <MODELS>
├─ <DATASETS>
├─ <SPACES>
```

The `<CACHE_DIR>` is usually your user's home directory. However, it is customizable with the
`cache_dir` argument on all methods, or by specifying the `HF_HOME` environment variable.

Models, datasets and spaces share a common root. Each of these repositories contains the namespace
(organization, username) if it exists, alongside the repository name:

```
<CACHE_DIR>
├─ models--julien-c--EsperBERTo-small
├─ models--lysandrejik--arxiv-nlp
├─ models--bert-base-cased
├─ datasets--glue
├─ datasets--huggingface--DataMeasurementsFiles
├─ spaces--dalle-mini--dalle-mini
```

It is within these folders that all files will now be downloaded from the hub. Caching ensures that
a file isn't downloaded twice if it already exists and wasn't updated; but if it was updated,
and you're asking for the latest file, then it will download the latest file (while keeping
the previous file intact in case you need it again).

In order to achieve this, all folders contain the same skeleton:

```
<CACHE_DIR>
├─ datasets--glue
│  ├─ refs
│  ├─ blobs
│  ├─ snapshots
...
```

Each folder is designed to contain the following:

### Refs

The `refs` folder contains files which indicates the latest revision of the given reference. For example,
if we have previously fetched a file from the `main` branch of a repository, the `refs`
folder will contain a file named `main`, which will itself contain the commit identifier of the current head.

If the latest commit of `main` has `aaaaaa` as identifier, then it will contain `aaaaaa`.

If that same branch gets updated with a new commit, that has `bbbbbb` as an identifier, then
redownloading a file from that reference will update the `refs/main` file to contain `bbbbbb`.

### Blobs

The `blobs` folder contains the actual files that we have downloaded. The name of each file is their hash.

### Snapshots

The `snapshots` folder contains symlinks to the blobs mentioned above. It is itself made up of several folders:
one per known revision!

In the explanation above, we had initially fetched a file from the `aaaaaa` revision, before fetching a file from
the `bbbbbb` revision. In this situation, we would now have two folders in the `snapshots` folder: `aaaaaa`
and `bbbbbb`.

In each of these folders, live symlinks that have the names of the files that we have downloaded. For example,
if we had downloaded the `READMD.md` file at revision `aaaaaa`, we would have the following path:

```
<CACHE_DIR>/<REPO_NAME>/snapshots/aaaaaa/README.md
```

That `README.md` file is actually a symlink linking to the blob that has the hash of the file.

Creating the skeleton this way means opens up the mechanism to file sharing: if the same file was fetched in
revision `bbbbbb`, it would have the same hash and the file would not need to be redownloaded.

### In practice

In practice, it should look like the following tree in your cache:
