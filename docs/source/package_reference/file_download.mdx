## Caching

The methods displayed above are designed to work with a caching system that prevents
re-downloading files. The caching system was updated in v0.8.0 to become the central
cache-system shared across libraries that depend on the Hub.

Read the [cache-system guide](../how-to-cache) for a detailed presentation of caching at
at HF.
