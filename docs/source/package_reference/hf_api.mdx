# Hugging Face Hub API

Below is the documentation for the `HfApi` class, which serves as a Python wrapper for the Hugging Face
Hub's API.

All methods from the `HfApi` are also accessible from the package's root directly, both approaches are detailed
below.

The following approach uses the method from the root of the package:

```python
from huggingface_hub import list_models

models = list_models()
```

The following approach uses the `HfApi` class:

```python
from huggingface_hub import HfApi

hf_api = HfApi()
models = hf_api.list_models()
```

Using the [`HfApi`] class directly enables you to configure the client. In particular, a
token can be passed to be authenticated in all API calls. This is different than
`huggingface-cli login` or [`login`] as the token is not persisted on the machine. One
can also specify a different endpoint than the Hugging Face's Hub (for example to interact
with a Private Hub).

```py
from huggingface_hub import HfApi

hf_api = HfApi(
    endpoint="https://huggingface.co", # Can be a Private Hub endpoint.
    token="hf_xxx", # Token is not persisted on the machine.
)
```

## `create_commit` API

## Hugging Face local storage

`huggingface_hub` stores the authentication information locally so that it may be re-used in subsequent
methods.

It does this using the [`HfFolder`] utility, which saves data at the root of the user.
