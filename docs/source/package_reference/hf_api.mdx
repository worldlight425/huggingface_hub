# Hugging Face Hub API

Below is the documentation for the `HfApi` class, which serves as a Python wrapper for the Hugging Face
Hub's API.

All methods from the `HfApi` are also accessible from the package's root directly, both approaches are detailed
below.

The following approach uses the method from the root of the package:

```python
from huggingface_hub import list_models

models = list_models()
```

The following approach uses the `HfApi` class:

```python
from huggingface_hub import HfApi

hf_api = HfApi()
models = hf_api.list_models()
```

Using the `HfApi` class directly enables you to set a different endpoint to that of the Hugging Face's Hub.

## Hugging Face local storage

`huggingface_hub` stores the authentication information locally so that it may be re-used in subsequent
methods.

It does this using the [`HfFolder`] utility, which saves data at the root of the user.

## Filtering helpers

Some helpers to filter repositories on the Hub are available in the `huggingface_hub` package.
