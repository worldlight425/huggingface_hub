# Upload files to the Hub

Sharing your files and work is an important aspect of the Hub. The `huggingface_hub` offers several options for uploading your files to the Hub. You can use these functions independently or integrate them into your library, making it more convenient for your users to interact with the Hub. This guide will show you how to push files:

* without using Git.
* that are very large with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
* with the `commit` context manager.
* with the [`~Repository.push_to_hub`] function.

Whenever you want to upload files to the Hub, you need to log in to your Hugging Face account:

- Log in to your Hugging Face account with the following command:

   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login
   ```

- Alternatively, if you prefer working from a Jupyter or Colaboratory notebook, log in with [`notebook_login`]:

   ```python
   >>> from huggingface_hub import notebook_login
   >>> notebook_login()
   ```

   [`notebook_login`] launches a widget in your notebook from which you can enter your Hugging Face credentials.

## Push files without Git

If you don't have Git installed on your system, use [`create_commit`] to push your files to the Hub. [`create_commit`] uses the HTTP protocol to upload files to the Hub.

However, [`create_commit`] is a low-level API for working at a commit level. The [`upload_file`] and [`upload_folder`] functions are higher-level APIs that use [`create_commit`] under the hood and are generally more convenient. We recommend trying these functions first if you don't need to work at a lower level.

### Upload a file

Once you've created a repository with the [`create_repo`](./how-to-manage#create-a-repository) function, you can upload a file to your repository with the [`upload_file`] function. 

Specify the path of the file to upload, where you want to upload the file to in the repository, and the name of the repository you want to add the file to. Depending on your repository type, you can optionally set the repository type as a `dataset`, `model`, or `space`.

```py
>>> from huggingface_hub import HfApi
>>> api = HfApi()
>>> api.upload_file(path_or_fileobj="/path/to/local/folder/README.md", 
...                 path_in_repo="README.md", 
...                 repo_id="username/test-dataset",
...                 repo_type="dataset",
... )
```

### Upload a folder

Use the [`upload_folder`] function to upload a local folder to an existing repository. Specify the path of the local folder to upload, where you want to upload the folder to in the repository, and the name of the repository you want to add the folder to. Depending on your repository type, you can optionally set the repository type as a `dataset`, `model`, or `space`.

```py
>>> from huggingface_hub import HfApi
>>> api = HfApi()
>>> api.upload_folder(folder_path="/path/to/local/folder",
...                   path_in_repo="my-dataset/train",
...                   repo_id="username/test-dataset",
...                   repo_type="dataset",
... )
```

### create_commit

If you want to work at a commit-level, use the [`create_commit`] function directly. There are two types of operations supported by [`create_commit`]:

- `CommitOperationAdd` uploads a file to the Hub. If the file already exists, the file contents are overwritten. This operation accepts two arguments:

   * `path_in_repo`: the repository path to upload a file to.
   * `path_or_fileobj`: either a path to a file on your filesystem or a file-like object. This is the content of the file to upload to the Hub.

- `CommitOperationDelete` removes a file from a repository. This operation accepts `path_in_repo` as an argument.

For example, if you want to upload two files and delete a file in a Hub repository:

1. Use the appropriate `CommitOperation` to add and delete a file:

```py
>>> from huggingface_hub import HfApi, CommitOperationAdd, CommitOperationDelete
>>> api = HfApi()
>>> operations = [
...     CommitOperationAdd(path_in_repo="LICENSE.md", path_or_fileobj="~/repo/LICENSE.md"),
...     CommitOperationAdd(path_in_repo="weights.h5", path_or_fileobj="~/repo/weights-final.h5"),
...     CommitOperationDelete(path_in_repo="old-weights.h5"),
... ]
```

2. Pass your operations to [`create_commit`]:

```py
>>> api.create_commit(
...     repo_id="lysandre/test-model",
...     operations=operations,
...     commit_message="Upload my model weights and license",
... )
```

In addition to [`upload_file`] and [`upload_folder`], the following functions also use [`create_commit`] under the hood: 

* [`delete_file`] deletes a single file from a repository on the Hub. 
* [`metadata_update`] updates a repository's metadata.

For more detailed information, take a look at the [`HfApi`] reference.

## Push files with Git LFS

Git LFS automatically handles files larger than 10MB. But for very large files (>5GB), you need to install a custom transfer agent for Git LFS:

```bash
huggingface-cli lfs-enable-largefiles
```

You should install this for each repository that has a very large file. Once installed, you'll be able to push files larger than 5GB.

## commit context manager

The `commit` context manager handles four of the most common Git commands: pull, add, commit, and push. `git-lfs` automatically tracks any file larger than 10MB. In the following example, the `commit` context manager:

1. Pulls from the `text-files` repository.
2. Adds a change made to `file.txt`.
3. Commits the change.
4. Pushes the change to the `text-files` repository.

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import Repository
>>> with Repository(local_dir="text-files", clone_from="<user>/text-files").commit(commit_message="My first file :)"):
...     with open("file.txt", "w+") as f:
...         f.write(json.dumps({"hey": 8}))
```

Here is another example of how to use the `commit` context manager to save and upload a file to a repository:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> model = torch.nn.Transformer()
>>> with Repository("torch-model", clone_from="<user>/torch-model", use_auth_token=True).commit(commit_message="My cool model :)"):
...     torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model.pt")
```

Set `blocking=False` if you would like to push your commits asynchronously. Non-blocking behavior is helpful when you want to continue running your script while your commits are being pushed.

```python
>>> with repo.commit(commit_message="My cool model :)", blocking=False)
```

You can check the status of your push with the `command_queue` method:

```python
>>> last_command = repo.command_queue[-1]
>>> last_command.status
```

Refer to the table below for the possible statuses:

| Status   | Description                          |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| -1       | The push is ongoing.                 |
| 0        | The push has completed successfully. |
| Non-zero | An error has occurred.               |

When `blocking=False`, commands are tracked, and your script will only exit when all pushes are completed, even if other errors occur in your script. Some additional useful commands for checking the status of a push include:

```python
# Inspect an error.
>>> last_command.stderr

# Check whether a push is completed or ongoing.
>>> last_command.is_done

# Check whether a push command has errored.
>>> last_command.failed
```

## push_to_hub

The [`Repository`] class has a [`~Repository.push_to_hub`] function to add files, make a commit, and push them to a repository. Unlike the `commit` context manager, you'll need to pull from a repository first before calling [`~Repository.push_to_hub`].

For example, if you've already cloned a repository from the Hub, then you can initialize the `repo` from the local directory:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import Repository
>>> repo = Repository(local_dir="path/to/local/repo")
```

Update your local clone with [`~Repository.git_pull`] and then push your file to the Hub:

```py
>>> repo.git_pull()
>>> repo.push_to_hub(commit_message="Commit my-awesome-file to the Hub")
```

However, if you aren't ready to push a file yet, you can use [`~Repository.git_add`] and [`~Repository.git_commit`] to only add and commit your file:

```py
>>> repo.git_add("path/to/file")
>>> repo.git_commit(commit_message="add my first model config file :)")
```

When you're ready, push the file to your repository with [`~Repository.git_push`]:

```py
>>> repo.git_push()
```
