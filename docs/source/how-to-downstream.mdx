# Download files from the Hub

The `huggingface_hub` library provides functions to download files from the repositories
stored on the Hub. You can use these functions independently or integrate them into your
own library, making it more convenient for your users to interact with the Hub. This
guide will show you how to:

* Specify a file to download from the Hub.
* Download and cache a file on your disk.
* Download all the files in a repository.

## Choose a file to download

Use the `filename` parameter in the [`hf_hub_url`] function to retrieve the URL of a
specific file to download:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_url
>>> hf_hub_url(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", filename="config.json")
'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/arxiv-nlp/resolve/main/config.json'
```

Specify a particular file version by providing the file revision, which can be the
branch name, a tag, or a commit hash. When using the commit hash, it must be the
full-length hash instead of a 7-character commit hash:

```python
>>> hf_hub_url(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", 
...            filename="config.json", 
...            revision="877b84a8f93f2d619faa2a6e514a32beef88ab0a",
... )
'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/arxiv-nlp/resolve/877b84a8f93f2d619faa2a6e514a32beef88ab0a/config.json'
```

To specify a file revision with the branch name:

```python
>>> hf_hub_url(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", filename="config.json", revision="main")
```

To specify a file revision with a tag identifier. For example, if you want `v1.0` of the
`config.json` file:

```python
>>> hf_hub_url(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", filename="config.json", revision="v1.0")
```

## Download and store a file

[`cached_download`] is used to download and cache a file on your local disk. Once a file
is stored in your cache, you don't have to redownload it the next time you use it.
[`cached_download`] is a hands-free solution for staying up to date with new file
versions. When a downloaded file is updated in the remote repository,
[`cached_download`] will automatically download and store it.

Begin by retrieving the file URL with [`hf_hub_url`], and then pass the specified URL to
[`cached_download`] to download the file:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_url, cached_download
>>> config_file_url = hf_hub_url("lysandre/arxiv-nlp", filename="config.json")
>>> cached_download(config_file_url)
'/home/lysandre/.cache/huggingface/hub/bc0e8cc2f8271b322304e8bb84b3b7580701d53a335ab2d75da19c249e2eeebb.066dae6fdb1e2b8cce60c35cc0f78ed1451d9b341c78de19f3ad469d10a8cbb1'
```

[`hf_hub_url`] and [`cached_download`] work hand-in-hand to download a file. This is
such a standard workflow that [`hf_hub_download`] is a wrapper that calls both of these
functions.

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
>>> hf_hub_download(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", filename="config.json")
```

## Download an entire repository

[`snapshot_download`] downloads an entire repository at a given revision. Like
[`cached_download`], all downloaded files are cached on your local disk. However, even
if only a single file is updated, the entire repository will be redownloaded.

Download a whole repository as shown in the following:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
>>> snapshot_download(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp")
'/home/lysandre/.cache/huggingface/hub/lysandre__arxiv-nlp.894a9adde21d9a3e3843e6d5aeaaf01875c7fade'
```

[`snapshot_download`] downloads the latest revision by default. If you want a specific
repository revision, use the `revision` parameter:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
>>> snapshot_download(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", revision="main")
```

In general, it is usually better to download files with [`hf_hub_download`] - if you
already know the file name - to avoid redownloading an entire repository.
[`snapshot_download`] is helpful when you are unaware of which files to download.

However, you don't always want to download the contents of an entire repository with
[`snapshot_download`]. Even if you don't know the file name, you can download specific
files if you know the file type with `allow_regex` and `ignore_regex`. Use the
`allow_regex` and `ignore_regex` arguments to specify which files to download. These
parameters accept either a single regex or a list of regexes. 

The regex matching is based on
[`fnmatch`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html), which provides support for
Unix shell-style wildcards.

For example, you can use `allow_regex` to only download JSON configuration files:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
>>> snapshot_download(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", allow_regex="*.json")
```

On the other hand, `ignore_regex` can exclude certain files from being downloaded. The
following example ignores the `.msgpack` and `.h5` file extensions:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
>>> snapshot_download(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", ignore_regex=["*.msgpack", "*.h5"])
```

Passing a regex can be especially useful when repositories contain files that are never
expected to be downloaded by [`snapshot_download`].

Note that passing `allow_regex` or `ignore_regex` does **not** prevent
[`snapshot_download`] from redownloading the entire model repository if an ignored file
is changed.
