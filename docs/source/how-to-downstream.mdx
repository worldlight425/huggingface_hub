# Download files from the Hub

The `huggingface_hub` library provides functions to download files from the repositories
stored on the Hub. You can use these functions independently or integrate them into your
own library, making it more convenient for your users to interact with the Hub. This
guide will show you how to:

* Download and store a file from the Hub.
* Download all the files in a repository.

## Download and store a file from the Hub

The [`hf_hub_download`] function is the main function for downloading files from the Hub.

It downloads the remote file, stores it on disk (in a version-aware way), and returns its local file path.

Use the `repo_id` and `filename` parameters to specify which file to download:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
>>> hf_hub_download(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", filename="config.json")
'/root/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--lysandre--arxiv-nlp/snapshots/894a9adde21d9a3e3843e6d5aeaaf01875c7fade/config.json'
```

<div class="flex justify-center">

<img class="hidden dark:block" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repo-dark.png"/>
</div>

Specify a particular file version by providing the file revision, which can be the
branch name, a tag, or a commit hash. When using the commit hash, it must be the
full-length hash instead of a 7-character commit hash:

```python
>>> hf_hub_download(
...    repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp",
...    filename="config.json",
...    revision="877b84a8f93f2d619faa2a6e514a32beef88ab0a",
... )
'/root/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--lysandre--arxiv-nlp/snapshots/877b84a8f93f2d619faa2a6e514a32beef88ab0a/config.json'
```

To specify a file revision with the branch name:

```python
>>> hf_hub_download(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", filename="config.json", revision="main")
```

To specify a file revision with a tag identifier. For example, if you want `v1.0` of the
`config.json` file:

```python
>>> hf_hub_download(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", filename="config.json", revision="v1.0")
```

## Construct a download URL

In case you want to construct the URL used to download a file from a repo, you can use [`hf_hub_url`] which returns a URL.
Note that it is used internally by [`hf_hub_download`].

## Download an entire repository

[`snapshot_download`] downloads an entire repository at a given revision. Like
[`hf_hub_download`], all downloaded files are cached on your local disk.

Download a whole repository as shown in the following:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
>>> snapshot_download(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp")
'/home/lysandre/.cache/huggingface/hub/lysandre__arxiv-nlp.894a9adde21d9a3e3843e6d5aeaaf01875c7fade'
```

[`snapshot_download`] downloads the latest revision by default. If you want a specific
repository revision, use the `revision` parameter:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
>>> snapshot_download(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", revision="main")
```

In general, it is usually better to download files with [`hf_hub_download`] - if you
already know the file names you need.
[`snapshot_download`] is helpful when you are unaware of which files to download.

However, you don't always want to download the contents of an entire repository with
[`snapshot_download`]. Even if you don't know the file name, you can download specific
files if you know the file type with `allow_regex` and `ignore_regex`. Use the
`allow_regex` and `ignore_regex` arguments to specify which files to download. These
parameters accept either a single regex or a list of regexes. 

The regex matching is based on
[`fnmatch`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html), which provides support for
Unix shell-style wildcards.

For example, you can use `allow_regex` to only download JSON configuration files:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
>>> snapshot_download(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", allow_regex="*.json")
```

On the other hand, `ignore_regex` can exclude certain files from being downloaded. The
following example ignores the `.msgpack` and `.h5` file extensions:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
>>> snapshot_download(repo_id="lysandre/arxiv-nlp", ignore_regex=["*.msgpack", "*.h5"])
```

Passing a regex can be especially useful when repositories contain files that are never
expected to be downloaded by [`snapshot_download`].
