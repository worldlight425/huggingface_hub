# Hugging Face Client library

## Download files from the huggingface.co hub

Integration inside a library is super simple. We expose two functions, `hf_hub_url()` and `cached_download()`.

### `hf_hub_url`

`hf_hub_url()` takes:
- a repo id (e.g. a model id like `julien-c/EsperBERTo-small` i.e. a user or organization name and a repo name, separated by `/`),
- a filename (like `pytorch_model.bin`),
- and an optional git revision id (can be a branch name, a tag, or a commit hash)

and returns the url we'll use to download the actual files: `https://huggingface.co/julien-c/EsperBERTo-small/resolve/main/pytorch_model.bin`

If you check out this URL's headers with a `HEAD` http request (which you can do from the command line with `curl -I`) for a few different files, you'll see that:
- small files are returned directly
- large files (i.e. the ones stored through [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)) are returned via a redirect to a Cloudfront URL. Cloudfront is a Content Delivery Network, or CDN, that ensures that downloads are as fast as possible from anywhere on the globe.

### `cached_download`

`cached_download()` takes the following parameters, downloads the remote file, stores it to disk (in a versioning-aware way) and returns its local file path.

Parameters:
- a remote `url`
- your library's name and version (`library_name` and `library_version`), which will be added to the HTTP requests' user-agent so that we can provide some usage stats.
- a `cache_dir` which you can specify if you want to control where on disk the files are cached.

Check out the source code for all possible params (we'll create a real doc page in the future).

### Bonus: `snapshot_download`

`snapshot_download()` downloads all the files from the remote repository at the specified revision, 
stores it to disk (in a versioning-aware way) and returns its local file path.

Parameters:
- a `repo_id` in the format `namespace/repository`
- a `revision` on which the repository will be downloaded
- a `cache_dir` which you can specify if you want to control where on disk the files are cached.

## Publish models to the huggingface.co hub

Uploading a model to the hub is super simple too:
- create a model repo directly from the website, at huggingface.co/new (models can be public or private, and are namespaced under either a user or an organization)
- clone it with git
- [download and install git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) if you don't already have it on your machine (you can check by running a simple `git lfs`)
- add, commit and push your files, from git, as you usually do.

**We are intentionally not wrapping git too much, so that you can go on with the workflow you‚Äôre used to and the tools you already know.**

> üëÄ To see an example of how we document the model sharing process in `transformers`, check out https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_sharing.html

Users add tags into their README.md model cards (e.g. your `library_name`, a domain tag like `audio`, etc.) to make sure their models are discoverable.

**Documentation about the model hub itself is at https://huggingface.co/docs**

### API utilities in `hf_api.py`

You don't need them for the standard publishing workflow, however, if you need a programmatic way of creating a repo, deleting it (`‚ö†Ô∏è caution`), pushing a single file to a repo or listing models from the hub, you'll find helpers in `hf_api.py`.

We also have an API to query models by specific tags (e.g. if you want to list models compatible to your library)

### `huggingface-cli`

Those API utilities are also exposed through a CLI:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
huggingface-cli logout
huggingface-cli whoami
huggingface-cli repo create
```

### Need to upload large (>5GB) files?

To upload large files (>5GB üî•), you need to install the custom transfer agent for git-lfs, bundled in this package. 

To install, just run:

```bash
$ huggingface-cli lfs-enable-largefiles
```

This should be executed once for each model repo that contains a model file >5GB. If you just try to push a file bigger than 5GB without running that command, you will get an error with a message reminding you to run it.

Finally, there's a `huggingface-cli lfs-multipart-upload` command but that one is internal (called by lfs directly) and is not meant to be called by the user.
